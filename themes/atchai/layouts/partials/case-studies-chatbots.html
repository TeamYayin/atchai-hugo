                <p>Danone is a multi-national food products corporation, present in over 130 countries.  They have the market leading product that is prescribed in the event that a child is diagnosed with cows milk allergy.</p><br>

                <p>It takes an average of 11 GP visits and 15 weeks from initial symtoms to diagnosis of CMA, causing a lot of unnecessary distress for parent and child.  We built a bot that acts as a companion for parents throughout this journey, helping them to track symptoms and produce a comprehensive report to take to the GP, significantly reducing the average diagnosis time for CMA.</p><br>

                <p>We're working with the UK Government Department of International Trade to develop an innovative new conversational AI product.  The laws around importing and exporting goods are complex, and cover everything from importing plants to exporting military hardware for repair. It can be extremely time consuming for the ordinary citizen or small business to understand whether they need a license, and if so which one.</p><br>
                <p>By using a conversational user interface, we can reduce the time it takes to find these answers, as well as reduce the burden on human advisors.</p>
