                    <p>Government has a legal responsibility to publish records that are in the national interest and respond to enquiries from the public in the form of freedom of information requests.</p>
                    <p>The volume of documents that government generates means that many departments are struggling to exploit their information fully.</p>

The laws around importing and exporting goods are complex, and cover everything from importing plans to exporting military hardware for repair. It can be extremely time consuming for the ordinary citizen or small business to understand whether they need a license, and if so which one.</p>
                    <p>By using a conversational user interface, we believe that we can reduce the time it takes to find these answers, as well as reducing the burden on human advisors.</p>
