The laws around importing and exporting goods are complex, and cover everything from importing plans to exporting military hardware for repair. It can be extremely time consuming for the ordinary citizen or small business to understand whether they need a license, and if so which one.</p>
                    <p>By using a conversational user interface, we believe that we can reduce the time it takes to find these answers, as well as reducing the burden on human advisors.</p>

                        <p>I was highly impressed by the way John runs his team, the agile way in which they approach the work and even more pleased with their ideas and technical input.
