                        Atchai won the project with a competitive bid proposing an open source technology stack including Drupal, integrated tightly with our own Dataseed platform. 200GB of data is imported quarterly into Dataseed&#8217;s RESTful API, enabling the public and clinicians to visually interrogate healthcare outcomes, admissions, prescriptions, and administrative datasets through a single, simple interface.</p>

It links these up with RDF data such as Ordnance Survey geo-data, to visualise the statistics in a variety of ways, using maps and charts, and allow the linked data to be queried with SPARQL.</p>
