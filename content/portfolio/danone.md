Danone is a multi-national food products corporation, present in over 130 countries.  They have the market leading product that is prescribed in the event that a child is diagnosed with cows milk allergy.

It takes an average of 11 GP visits and 15 weeks from initial symtoms to diagnosis of CMA, causing a lot of unnecessary distress for parent and child.  We built a bot that acts as a companion for parents throughout this journey, helping them to track symptoms and produce a comprehensive report to take to the GP, significantly reducing the average diagnosis time for CMA.

Bots are a great solution for bridging gaps in the customer journey and offering complementary tools that provide utility to your customers.
