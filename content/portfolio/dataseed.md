## Key Features

Dataseed offers a simple way to create multi-dimensional interactive visualisations. It's takes just a few minutes to import a spreadsheet before we present you with a visualisation, allowing you to instantly start exploring your data with clickable charts.

An API is provided so that you can update your data in real-time.  We can handle millions of rows, and we use in-memory technology to aggregate data before it is sent to the browser.

We respect Tufte’s principles of information design - there’s no chartjunk, and a high data-to-ink ratio.

The front-end of Dataseed is [open-source](https://github.com/dataseed/dataseed-visualisation) so that you have full control over the appearance of your visualisations. There is also a [Drupal module](https://drupal.org/project/dataseed) to enable rapid integration with the Drupal CMS.
