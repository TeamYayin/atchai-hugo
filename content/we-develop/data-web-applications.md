### How we do Data Science
In recent years there have been massive advances in <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>natural language processing</strong> - the main disciplines that we refer to when we say AI. We can help you unlock the value of these advances and understand how they can be applied to your business.

Once we have developed hypotheses for how your data can be used, we take a scientific approach and define clear <strong>experiments</strong> that can be run in order to determine the value of a potential intervention.  

We specialise in unlocking value held in <strong>text and unstructured data</strong>.  Most organisations have a treasure trove of documents, product or service reviews, emails, support enquiries, or other data that can be better exploited within the organisation.  

There's no magic here!  Our <a href="about-us/how-we-work/">Agile</a> approach to applied AI means empowering employees and customers with smarter tools.

### Cutting Edge Technology
Our tech stack is constantly evolving - we embrace new technology and weâ€™re always learning.  

For machine learning and NLP we use mature open source tools including <strong>Spacy</strong>, <strong>NLTK</strong>, <strong>Tensorflow</strong>, <strong>Keras</strong>, <strong>Pytorch</strong>.  These allow us to train using your data in secure cloud environments with complete privacy. <strong>Apache Spark with Python</strong> may be used to scale models horizontally, typically deployed on AWS or Microsoft Azure.

We build <strong>micro-services</strong> that expose RESTful APIs for easy integration.  Modern datastores provide a wide range of options, we work a lot with <strong>Elasticsearch</strong>, <strong>Postgres</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong>.  Our web applications typically use a full-stack <strong>javascript/Node.js</strong> approach.
