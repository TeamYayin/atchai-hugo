### Smart and sophisticated
Modern apps need to do more than just look beautiful. Great user experience has become the standard, so in order to differentiate you need to build innovative technology.  We develop web applications that use <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>natural language processing</strong>.  We work with you in an <a href="about-us/how-we-work/">Agile process</a>, providing full-stack product development.  

<br>
### Cutting Edge Technology 
Our tech stack is constantly evolving - We embrace new technology and weâ€™re always learning.  For big data pipelines and machine learning / NLP at scale we use <strong>Apache Spark with Python</strong> and Scala, typically deployed on AWS.  We build <strong>micro-services</strong> that communicate via task queues such as RabbitMQ.  Modern datastores provide a wide range of options, we work a lot with <strong>Elasticsearch</strong>, <strong>Postgres</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong>.  Our web applications are moving towards a full-stack <strong>javascript/Node.js</strong> approach.
