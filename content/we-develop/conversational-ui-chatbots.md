## Rise of the Bots
Messaging apps have become ubiquitous.  The top four messaging apps can claim higher engagement with more monthly active users than the big four social networks.  Voice interfaces continue the pervasive computing trend, rapidly becoming mainstream and blending into our environments.  



<br>
## Chatbot development
We develop chatbots for web, mobile and all the major messaging platforms including <strong>Facebook Messenger</strong>, <strong>Slack</strong> and voice interfaces such as <strong>Amazon Alexa</strong>.  We provide a full chatbot co-creation service, working with you to develop a concept, design and test the product in an iterative process with real users.  Our machine learning and NLP experience helps us inject magic into the experience!
