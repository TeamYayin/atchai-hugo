## Rise of the Bots
Messaging apps have become ubiquitous.  The top four messaging apps can claim higher engagement with more monthly active users than the big four social networks.  Voice interfaces continue the pervasive computing trend, rapidly becoming mainstream and blending into our environemnts.  75% of US households will own a voice activated assistant by 2020 (Gartner).
