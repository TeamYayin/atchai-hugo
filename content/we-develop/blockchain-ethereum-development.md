### Decentralized Application Development
We build decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum platform. These applications are deployed either on the public blockchain or in a private permissioned environment.  

Our team have extensive experience with developing smart contracts using solidity and adhering to security best practices.  Our code has been audited and approved by leading auditors including ConsenSys Dilligence.

Our CEO is a founding member of the <a href="https://1337alliance.com/">EIP1337</a> working group and is active in the development of improvements and new standards for the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Full Product Development
Do you need a <strong>technical partner</strong> who can help develop your product roadmap and turn it into reality?  We work with you in an open, <a href="about-us/how-we-work/">collaborative Agile process</a>, delivering working software from the very first sprint.  We understand what's required to bring a new product to market - from validation, through to <strong>scaling for millions of users</strong>.
