### Decentralized Application Development
We build decentralized applications (dApps) that are deployed either on a public blockchain or on a private permissioned enterprise blockchain.  

Our team have extensive experience with developing smart contracts and adhering to security best practices.  Our code has been audited and approved by leading auditors including ConsenSys Dilligence.

Our CEO is a founding member of the <a href="https://1337alliance.com/">EIP1337</a> working group and is active in the development of improvements and new standards for the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Full Service
Do you need a <strong>technical partner</strong> who can help develop your product roadmap and turn it into reality?  We work with you in an open, <a href="about-us/how-we-work/">collaborative Agile process</a>, delivering working software from the very first sprint.  We understand what's required to bring a new product to market - from validation, through to <strong>scaling for millions of users</strong>.
